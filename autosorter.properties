# DO NOT rename or remove "folder_path".
# This is the folder that will be scanned.
# All other keys will be treated as sorting rules.
#
# NOTE: In Windows paths, use double backslashes (\\) instead of single ones (\)
#       For example: C:\\Users\\username\\Downloads\\
#

folder_path=C:\\YourFolder

# Add your custom sorting rules below:
# Format:
# FolderName=.ext1,.ext2,.ext3
#
# You may add as many rules as you want.
# You may use any folder names you prefer.
# Extensions must start with a dot.
# --------------------------------------

# Examples (you may delete or replace them):
Photos=.jpg,.jpeg,.png
